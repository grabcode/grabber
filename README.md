# Grabber

Grabber is a Chrome Extension providing an easy way to download the assets of a page.

## Story

My kids go at this Childcare using a CMS called `storypark`. They publish stories containing some picture and I intend to get my kids photos for some family albums.

## Hurdle

Storypark does not provide an easy way to get this photos, for some reasons. They have disabled right click. And even with the chrome inspector, it's too much of a pain to download each file one by one. Hence Grabber.

## Details

For now, Grabber is pretty non friendly, and stupid. You need to provide the CSS selector to apply, and Grabber would work only with images.
